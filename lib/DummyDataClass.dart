This price adjustment will come into effect on February 1, 2024, and aims to partially offset the ever-rising input costs.
This move follows Tata Motors earlier decision in April 2023 to raise the prices of its passenger vehicle (PV) range by approximately 0.6 per cent, starting from 1 May.
The automotive industry has witnessed a trend, with various manufacturers, including industry giant Maruti Suzuki, resorting to similar price hikes in the early months of FY24. Maruti Suzuki cited inflation and heightened commodity prices as reasons for their decision, with the actual percentage of the price hike varying across models.
Adding to the chorus, German luxury carmaker Audi declared a price increase of up to 2 per cent for its vehicles effective 1 January. The rationale provided by Audi pointed to the escalating supply-chain-related input and operational costs, necessitating a price correction while maintaining the brand's premium price positioning.

More people prefer buying a top-end variant of the vehicle, with the percentage of buyers rising from 27 per cent about a year ago to 43 per cent now.
There is a clear shift towards premiumisation, says Shashank Srivastava, senior executive officer, marketing and sales, Maruti Suzuki India. “People now want more features in their vehicles. In the same model, they are opting for the one with more features. For example, non-AC models are virtually non-existent. There was a time when there was demand for non-AC models,” Srivastava explains.
Tata Motors agrees. The company says that the average sales price has been increasing across the industry.''',

    Apple has disabled the pulse oximetry feature on its smartwatches, which infringe on patents held by medical technology firm Masimo. As a result, customers who purchase these two models in the US will not be able to measure their blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels.

Masimo CEO Joe Kiani told Bloomberg that Apple had not reached out to the medical technology firm to discuss a settlement amid the ongoing legal dispute between both firms. Apple has appealed a ruling of the International Trade Commission (ITC) in October that said the company infringed on Masimo's patents related to pulse oximetry, a feature that was first introduced with the Apple Watch Series 6.

Earlier this week, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that Apple could not sell both models with the blood oxygen feature, while refusing to pause the import ban during the appeal period.''',

    that's because it appears very similar to Apple's always-on Lock screen wallpaper feature, which is available on recent iPhone Pro models. But Samsung seems to have added its own twist to it.
    Samsung basically adds another layer to it by allowing the lockscreen wallpaper to shine through, taking advantage of the new and reportedly more power-efficient LTPO panels, which can refresh at 1Hz, while sipping on as little power as possible. Samsung also lets users erase the background of its lockscreen wallpaper,
     keeping only the subject visible,
